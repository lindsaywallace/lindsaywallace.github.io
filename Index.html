    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I was born and raised in Dallas, TX. Iâ€™ve had internships as a business administration intern and a marketing/IT intern. In my marketing/IT internship I gained some brief experience in MIS by working with the ERP system Microsoft Dynamics Nav. Since then I have gained a much deeper understanding of MIS and Accounting thorugh relevant coursework and projects. I chose Accounting and MIS for my degree path because I enjoy working with numbers and have an apptitude for thinking technically. </p>
